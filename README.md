# Licence-Plate-Recogniton-and-character-extraction
- The Automatic number plate
recognition system using vehicle license
plates is presented. This system uses image
processing techniques for recognising the
vehicle from the database stored in the
computer . For a wide range of situations
and number plate kinds, the system performs
satisfactorily. The system is implemented,
run using YOLOV4 and Opencv, and its
performance is evaluated using real photos.
- The proposed model, which has a lower
computational complexity than earlier
CNN-based approaches, can elegantly
address the issue of detecting car license
plates and is also easily deployable in
real-time scenarios. The YOLO framework
produces new state-of-the-art accuracy with
the addition of an attention-like pre positive
CNN model.
